            <p>I started playing soccer when I was a kid. Although I don't play competitively,
            I often play with my friends when we have spare time. I also watch soccer, mostly La Liga, as a Real Madrid fan.</p>

            <p>I started learning Blender when COVID hit, and since then I have learned more about 3D modeling and basic animation 
            through online tutorials and self-teaching.</p>

            <p>I started reading self-development books a year ago, and now I have made it a habit. If there are any books I would recommend to people who would like
            to learn more about good habits and consistency, my personal picks would be: The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson, The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz, 
            and Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.</p>
