    		<h2>What Does a Game Designer Do?</h2>
    		<p>A game designer is responsible for creating the concepts, mechanics, and overall gameplay experience of a video game. This role includes brainstorming ideas, designing characters and levels, writing scripts, and collaborating with artists, programmers, and producers to bring a game to life. Game designers also playtest their games to ensure they are engaging and fun for players.
    		Game designers often need creativity, technical skills, and an understanding of user experience to create games that resonate with players. </p>
